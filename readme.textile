A partial JavaScript port of Bob Tinker's NetLogo model exploring Self-Organised Criticality: Bureaucrats.v6

bq. The mathematics of avalanche size and frequency follows a power law that can be simulated to
    a first approximation by any system that exhibits self-organized criticality (SOC). In "How
    Nature Works"" Per Bak reports a simplified model of a sandpile that he, Chao Tang, and Curt
    Wiesenfeld developed that shows SOC, the so-called BTW model. Bak also mentions that
    Grassberger describes a representation of this model that is fanciful but equivalent to the
    BTW model. Imagine an N-by-N grid of office desks and a bureaucrat sitting at each. A folder
    is randomly assigned to one desk. The bureaucrat does nothing until four or more folders are
    on his desk at which time he sends one to each of his four nearest neighbors. Any bureaucrat
    sitting at the edge of this array throws a folder out the window if there is no desk to send
    it to. Sometimes, adding one folder can cause multiple redistributions of folders as one
    bureaucrat's actions causes neighbors to exceed three folders, which then ripples through
    the office. In principle, just adding one new folder might involve redistribution at every
    desk, sometimes multiple times.
