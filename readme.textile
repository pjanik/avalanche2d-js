I'm working on new ways of being able to create and run models in html5 browser-technologies that we used to build with Java and wanted to see how hard it would be to convert one of Bob's NetLogo models.

The avalanche/bureaucrat model was a good first choice because it only uses the patches feature of NetLogo and not turtles.

While it would take a good deal more work to make a whole authoring environment that would be effective and productive for non-professional programmers I think this is a very successful proof-of-concept. At this point I think it would be relatively easy to convert a model that had turtles also.

bq. The mathematics of avalanche size and frequency follows a power law that can be simulated to
    a first approximation by any system that exhibits self-organized criticality (SOC). In "How
    Nature Works"" Per Bak reports a simplified model of a sandpile that he, Chao Tang, and Curt
    Wiesenfeld developed that shows SOC, the so-called BTW model. Bak also mentions that
    Grassberger describes a representation of this model that is fanciful but equivalent to the
    BTW model. Imagine an N-by-N grid of office desks and a bureaucrat sitting at each. A folder
    is randomly assigned to one desk. The bureaucrat does nothing until four or more folders are
    on his desk at which time he sends one to each of his four nearest neighbors. Any bureaucrat
    sitting at the edge of this array throws a folder out the window if there is no desk to send
    it to. Sometimes, adding one folder can cause multiple redistributions of folders as one
    bureaucrat's actions causes neighbors to exceed three folders, which then ripples through
    the office. In principle, just adding one new folder might involve redistribution at every
    desk, sometimes multiple times.

**All these tests were run on a MacBook Pro, 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7, Mac OS X 10.6.8.**

On the same computer using NetLogo 5.0.rc1 the model averaged 21 samples/s when run for 5000 avalanche model steps.
